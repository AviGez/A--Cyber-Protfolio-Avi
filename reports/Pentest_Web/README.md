# 🌐 Wireshark Network Analysis Report – Suspicious HTTP Traffic  
**Analyst:** Avi Gaz  
**Tools Used:** Wireshark + AI-Assisted Packet Classification  
**Date:** ___________

---

## 1. Executive Summary  
A pcap file revealed scanning behavior from an external IP targeting port **80** on a web server.  
Following the scan, the attacker sent multiple **HTTP GET requests** to unusual paths, suggesting **reconnaissance** and potential **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** attempts.  
No data exfiltration was detected.

---

## 2. Key Findings  

### ✔ 1. Port Scanning Detected  
The attacker repeatedly attempted TCP connections:

```
Src IP: 185.222.12.55
Dst IP: 10.0.0.15
Dst Port: 80 (HTTP)
Flags: SYN
```

This pattern indicates **reconnaissance** — attacker mapping open ports.

---

### ✔ 2. Successful HTTP Connection  
Three-way handshake captured:

```
SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK
```

This means the web server accepted the connection and communication began.

---

### ✔ 3. Suspicious HTTP Requests  
The attacker accessed unusual URLs:

```
GET /admin/
GET /backup.zip
GET /../../etc/passwd
```

**Interpretation:**
- `/admin/` → Checking for weak admin panels  
- `/backup.zip` → Trying to steal sensitive configs  
- `/../../etc/passwd` → LFI attempt (path traversal attack)

---

### ✔ 4. HTTP Response Codes  
Server responded with:

```
200 OK        (file exists)
403 Forbidden (blocked)
404 Not Found (doesn't exist)
```

Meaning:
- The attacker indeed accessed some valid resources (200 OK)  
- The server blocked risky ones (403)

---

### ✔ 5. No Evidence of Exploitation  
No large outbound traffic  
No file downloads  
No shell payloads  
No anomalies in sequence numbers  

---

## 3. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

### Attacker
```
185.222.12.55
```

### Target Server
```
10.0.0.15
```

### Suspicious Paths
```
/admin/
/backup.zip
/../../etc/passwd
```

## 4. Timeline

| Time      | Event                                    |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| 12:04:10  | SYN flood-like scanning on port 80        |
| 12:04:20  | Handshake established                     |
| 12:04:23  | Suspicious GET request: /admin/           |
| 12:04:24  | Suspicious GET request: /backup.zip       |
| 12:04:25  | LFI attempt: ../../etc/passwd             |
| 12:04:30  | Attacker disconnects                      |

---

## 5. Root Cause  
The attacker exploited exposed HTTP services to perform enumeration of directories and potential LFI.

---

## 6. Mitigations  
- Block attacker IP at firewall  
- Disable directory browsing  
- Enforce validation of HTTP paths  
- Add WAF rules against LFI  
- Remove sensitive files from web root  
- Monitor for future scans on ports 80/443  

---

## 7. Final Assessment  
Severity: **Medium**  
No exploitation occurred, but reconnaissance attempts confirm active probing of the web server.

---

## 8. Lessons Learned  
- Always restrict access to `/admin/`  
- Keep sensitive files out of web directories  
- Harden server path-handling logic  
- Monitor scanning patterns closely
