# 🌐 Web Pentest Report – Critical Vulnerabilities  
**Analyst:** Avi Gaz  
**Tools Used:** Burp Suite, Nmap, Gobuster, Manual Testing  
**Date:** ___________

---

## 1. Executive Summary  
A security assessment was performed on the web application.  
Several high-severity vulnerabilities were identified, including:

- **SQL Injection**
- **Authentication Bypass**
- **Reflected XSS**
- **Directory Traversal (LFI)**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure**

If exploited, these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to steal data, bypass login, execute code, or gain administrative access.

---

## 2. Scope of Testing  
- Login page  
- Products page  
- Search feature  
- Admin panel  
- API endpoints  
- Static resources (`/assets`, `/images`)  

---

## 3. Findings Overview  
| ID | Name | Severity | Description |
|----|------|----------|-------------|
| F1 | SQL Injection | Critical | Database query manipulation |
| F2 | Authentication Bypass | High | Login allowed weak logic |
| F3 | Reflected XSS | High | JavaScript executed in browser |
| F4 | Directory Traversal (LFI) | High | Reading local server files |
| F5 | Sensitive Data Exposure | Medium | Debug info leaked |

## 4. Detailed Findings  

---

### 🔥 F1 – SQL Injection (Critical)  
**Endpoint:**  
```
/login
```

**Payload used:**  
```
' OR '1'='1' --
```

**Result:**  
Attacker bypassed authentication and logged in as admin.

**Evidence:**  
Application did not sanitize input and returned a valid session cookie.

**Impact:**  
- Full account takeover  
- Potential database access  
- Escalation to remote code execution  

**Recommendation:**  
- Use parameterized queries  
- Validate input  
- Apply WAF rules  

---

### 🔥 F2 – Authentication Bypass (High)  
**Issue:**  
Login form accepted any password with correct username length.

**Example:**  
Entering username:  
```
admin
```
Password:  
```
aaaaaa
```
→ Login successful.

**Cause:**  
Weak password validation logic.

**Impact:**  
Complete login bypass.

**Fix:**  
- Implement proper authentication flow  
- Add brute-force protection  

---

### 🔥 F3 – Reflected XSS (High)  
**Endpoint:**  
```
/search?q=
```

**Payload:**  
```
"><script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

**Result:**  
The script executed inside the victim’s browser.

**Risk:**  
- Session theft  
- Redirecting victims  
- Defacing pages  

**Mitigation:**  
- Escape output (HTML encoding)  
- Validate input  

---

### 🔥 F4 – Directory Traversal / LFI (High)  
**Endpoint:**  
```
/download?file=
```

**Payload:**  
```
../../../../../etc/passwd
```

**Result:**  
Server returned system file contents.

**Impact:**  
- Leak of sensitive OS files  
- Possible remote code execution  

**Fix:**  
- Restrict file paths  
- Use allow-list of filenames  

---

### 🔥 F5 – Sensitive Information Disclosure (Medium)  
**Found at:**  
```
/api/debug
```

**Issue:**  
Debug endpoint exposed full stack traces and internal paths.

**Risk:**  
- Attackers gain knowledge about server technologies  
- Easier exploitation  

**Fix:**  
- Disable debug mode in production  

---

## 5. Final Assessment  
| Severity | Count |
|----------|--------|
| Critical | 1 |
| High | 3 |
| Medium | 1 |

The application is **not secure** and vulnerable to multiple direct and indirect attacks.

---

## 6. Recommendations  
- Harden authentication flows  
- Implement secure coding practices  
- Sanitize all input  
- Escape all output  
- Disable debugging  
- Perform continuous scanning with SAST/DAST tools
